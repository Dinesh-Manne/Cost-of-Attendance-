# Creating Custom Icons for Your Extension

## Quick Steps:

### Method 1: Use the HTML Generator (Easiest)

1. **Open** `create-icons.html` in your browser
2. **Click** "Download All Icons" button
3. The three icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) will download
4. **Save** them in the extension folder (same folder as manifest.json)
5. **Reload** your extension in Chrome

### Method 2: Use Online Tools

If you want a different design:

1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Create or upload a 512x512 image with your design
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename them to: icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
5. Place in extension folder

### Method 3: Use Design Software

If you have Photoshop, Figma, or similar:

1. Create three PNG files with these exact sizes:
   - **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (appears in toolbar)
   - **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (appears in extensions page)
   - **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (appears in Chrome Web Store)

2. Design tips:
   - Use a simple, bold design
   - Make sure it's recognizable at small sizes (16x16)
   - Use 2-3 colors max for clarity
   - Consider a blue background with white symbol
   - Ideas: $ symbol, calculator icon, clock + money, meeting room

3. Save as PNG files
4. Place in extension folder

## Icon Design Ideas:

### Current Design (Generated by create-icons.html):
- Blue circle background
- White dollar sign ($)
- Small dots representing meeting attendees
- Clean and professional

### Alternative Ideas:
1. **Calculator with $** - Simple calculator icon with dollar symbol
2. **Clock + Money** - Clock face with dollar sign
3. **People + $** - Group of people icons with money symbol
4. **Meeting Room** - Conference table with dollar sign above
5. **Timer with Cost** - Stopwatch with cost indicator

## After Adding Icons:

1. Place icon files in: `/Users/dineshmanne/Documents/COA /`
2. Verify files are named exactly: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Click **Reload** button under your extension
5. Check the toolbar - you should see your custom icon!

## Troubleshooting:

- **Still seeing "M"?** Make sure icon files are in the correct folder
- **Icons not loading?** Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Blurry icons?** Make sure each PNG is the exact size (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
- **Wrong colors?** Edit the canvas colors in create-icons.html and re-download

## Need Help?

The `manifest.json` is already updated to use these icons. Just create the three PNG files and reload!
